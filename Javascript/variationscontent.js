CSS profiles are a subset of one or more CSS levels that are put together for a specific device or user interface.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/\"/>World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) maintain and develop the current standards for the World Wide Web. They develop protocols and guidelines for web aspects such as CSS to try and ensure all webpages display consistently for everyone.</p>",

				"<h3>CSS 1</h3> <p>CSS 1 was the first specification to become officially recommended. It included support for elements such as:</p> <ul> <li>Font properties</li> <li>Text attributes, such as line and letter spacing</li> <li>Colours for elements such as text and backgrounds</li> <li>Alignment of elements</li> <li>Positioning elements, such as margins and padding</li> <li>Unique identification of attributes and groups</li> </ul> <p>CSS 1 is no longer maintained by the W3C.</p><p>The full specification for CSS 1 can be viewed <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/\"/>here</a>. It specifies every property that can be applied to elements to style them.</p>",
				
				"<h3>CSS 2</h3> <p>CSS 2 was developed as a superset of CSS 1, building on a number of its features. It included a number of new capabilities in its extensions such as:</p> <ul> <li>Specific types of positioning for elements</li> <li>New font properties such as text shadows</li> <li>Specifications for media types</li> </ul> <p>CSS 2 is no longer maintained by the W3C.</p><p>The full specification for CSS 2 can be viewed <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS2-20080411/\"/>here</a>. It specifies every property that can be applied to elements to style them.</p>",
				
				"<h3>CSS 2.1</h3><p>CSS 2.1 is a descriptor for “CSS level 2 revision 1”, and as suggested by its name is a revision of CSS 2. It removes errors and poorly supported features of CSS 2.</p><p>CSS 2.1 is still currently maintained as a specification. </p><p>The full specification for CSS 2.1 can be viewed <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/\"/>here</a>. It specifies every property that can be applied to elements to style them.</p>",
				
				"<h3>CSS 3</h3> <p>CSS 3 differs from the other levels thus far as rather than being a single large specification, it is divided into multiple documents known as ‘modules’. These modules independently add or extend features to CSS 2. As a result CSS 3 is backwards compatible with CSS 2, and in fact all versions of CSS.</p> <p>Currently there are over 50 CSS 3 modules published, including 4 that are now formal recommendations:</p> <ul> <li>Media queries</li> <li>Namespaces</li> <li>Selectors (level 3)</li> <li>Color</li> </ul><p>An introduction to CSS 3 and all of its seperate modules can be found <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-css3-roadmap-20010523/\"/>here</a>.</p>",
				
				"<h3>CSS 4</h3> <p>Currently there is no single CSS 4 specification, rather there are several ‘level 4’ modules that can be collectively referred to as CSS 4. The level 4 modules that exist build on the functionality of level 3 modules, such as</p> <ul> <li>Image values</li> <li>Backgrounds and borders</li> <li>Selectors</li> </ul>",
